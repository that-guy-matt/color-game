# Color Picker game

Guess the correct RGB Color. A simple project using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## General Info

This is a clone of Colt Steele's Color Game project from his [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy.

I hand typed and refactored most of the code in this project to my own liking and to the best of my current knowledge of JavaScript as of the writing of this README file.

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Project Status

This project is at a current working state functionally and visibly the same as Colt Steele's original.

### To-do

* Add color change affects to buttons when header changes on winning state
* Optimize for multiple browser support (untested)
